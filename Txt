Subject: Let's Fuel Fun & Foster Connections!
Hi Team,
As we all know, our team thrives on a positive and engaging work environment. To keep the spirit high and foster stronger connections amongst us, we're planning some exciting team-building activities for the upcoming cycle.
To make these events a reality, we need your support!
We're requesting a voluntary contribution of â‚¹500 from each team member to help cover the costs of these fun-filled activities.
Your contribution will directly support:
 * Team-building events: From exciting outings and workshops to casual get-togethers, these activities will help us bond, learn, and grow together.
 * Employee appreciation initiatives: We want to recognize and celebrate the hard work and dedication of each team member.
 * Special occasions: This fund will also help us celebrate birthdays, farewells, and other special moments within our team.
We understand that everyone has their own financial commitments, and your contribution is entirely voluntary. However, every little bit helps!
Let's come together and make this cycle even more memorable and enjoyable for everyone.
Please let us know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further.
Thank you for your support!
Best regards,
[Your Name/Team Lead Name]
Note:
 * You can further customize this by adding specific examples of planned activities (e.g., "a weekend hiking trip," "a team lunch," "a workshop on communication skills," etc.)
 * Consider creating a transparent system for tracking and using the funds.
 * You can also set up a separate fund for special occasions if preferred.
I hope this revised version is more helpful!
